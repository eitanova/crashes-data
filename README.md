# Data Science Project - Crashed data & manipulations

### Motivation
We used this platform to analyse data related to accident and to come with 
the follow conclusions:
>    1. Men vs. Woman - who fault is it?
>    2. Which city / area is the most dangerous place to drive
>    3. On which age you must likely to be involved in accident
